**Branch**: branches let you create a new line of the current work to experiment on, without disturbing the original code. <br>
**Clone**: a clone is a local copy of your repository.<br>
**Commit**: when you make a change to a file, you hit the commit, this lets you see the specific revisions made to the file.<br>
**Fetch**: fetch downloads new data from remote repositories. <br>
**GIT**: a tool used to commit/push and perform other various functions from your webstorm to your github account. <br>
**Github**: a site that lets you store your work which can further be shared online.<br>
**Merge**: merge allows you to fuse all or some of your branches into the original work.<br>
**Merge Conflict**: when 2 or more users delete or merge the same line together this leads to merge conflicts.<br>
**Push**: push is the opposite of fetch, it lets you upload your repository online to Github for others to see/use.<br>
**Pull**: pull allows you to notify members that you have made changes to your code.<br>
**Remote**: a remote is a repository thats is stored on github for all team members to use.<br>
**Repository**: a file of code pushed online via websstorm and git for you and or your team to work on.<br>
